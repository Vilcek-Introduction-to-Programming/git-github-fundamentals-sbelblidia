## What I learned about Git/GtHub:

## Git and GitHub are both pretty new to me, as someone who has limited practice in computational work (to the extent of bash and some python). Through this class I learned a little more about the function of repositories and how to use R and R Rtudio in tandem with GitHub to maximize your work.

## Wilson et al's good practices for computational reproducibility:

## Wilson et al suggest multiple practices for ensuring good reproducibility. Among these practices is the storage of raw data and clear direction on manipulating it. It is important to keep your data stored in raw format, in order to be able to reproduce your analysis and results. Any and all manipulations/analyses should be done on a duplicated collection of the data. In addition to clearly naming and organizing your data in easy to understand locations, it is also important to add a readme file with directions on how to analyze/manipulate the raw data. The goal is for someone who is not familiar with your research to be given your files and be able to reproduce what you report.
